# How to use this app

- Save ideas about what goals you would like to pursue anytime, then go to https://chat.openai.com/, open a new chat, open the extension, and click on the eye of any of your goals to seek help from ChatGPT. Sign in if needed.
- Currently in version 1.0.2 this will do the following. It will configure ChatGPT, with just that one click the following will happen
- ChatGPT will be configured as a life coach trained in every method it can get its hands on and will start coaching you, most often one step at a time through his selected method.
- ChatGPT will switch methods mid process on demand with the reply "switch"
- ChatGPT will remember which methods you liked the best and will adapt to select those from its randomly selected methods more often slowly, in other words, it is programmed to get to know you and what works for you.

# Recent Feature Completions

- ✔️ The ability to prime chatGPT to coach you in different ways
- ✔️ Interdisciplinary methodologies for coaching styles
- ✔️ working from boilerplate code, create an app that will accept the goals of the user
- ✔️ Enable a user to easily and effortlessly get help from ChatGPT in relation to a goal they are working towards.
- ✔️ Then add a button for the user to be able to click to automatically prime chatGPT with the request for coaching

# Future Iterations

The most likely next steps for the development of this tool will include

- The ability to check in in relation to your goals and have chatGPT be aware of the progress or challenges
- ✔️ this is partly complete. ChatGPT will account for progress and challenges as you go now, in the future I aim to enable you to add check ins and challenges regularly so that chatGPT will be primed with this information for greater continuity.

### Objectives coming up next
